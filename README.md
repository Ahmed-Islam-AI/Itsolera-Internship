## Project Overview

Each project is organized into its own folder. The projects in this repository reflect a wide range of applications in the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence. From image recognition and natural language processing to predictive modeling, our projects highlight the power of AI in solving real-world challenges.

### Projects

1. **Content Moderation System**
   - Description: In the digital age, content moderation is crucial to maintaining a safe and welcoming environment on platforms that host user-generated content. Our system leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to detect and filter inappropriate content in both text and images.
   - Location: `./Content Moderation Project 1/`

2. **[Attendance System Using Face recognition]**
   - Description: Brief overview of the project, its goals, and the technology stack used.
   - Location: `./Attendance System Using Face recognition/`



### Each project directory typically contains:

- **`data/`**: Dataset files used for training and testing.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks or scripts with code and explanations.
- **`src/`**: Source code for the project, including model architectures and utility functions.
- **`README.md`**: Specific details about each individual project, including setup instructions, results, and references.

## Setup Instructions
