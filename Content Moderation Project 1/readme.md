# Introduction

In the digital age, content moderation is crucial to maintaining a safe and welcoming environment on platforms that host user-generated content. Our system leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to detect and filter inappropriate content in both text and images.

# Features

- **Text Moderation**: Detects and filters harmful, abusive, or inappropriate text content using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
- **Image Moderation**: Identifies and flags images containing inappropriate content using deep learning models.
- **Dual Model Approach**: Separate models are used for text and image moderation, ensuring specialized and accurate detection.

# Team Contribution

This project is the result of a collaborative effort by a diverse team:

- **Text Data Moderation**:
  - **[Arham Khan](https://github.com/arhamkhan779)**
  - **[Mobeen Mughal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mobeen-mughal-53463b203/)**
  - **[Muhammad Hamza](https://github.com/mrhamxo)**
  
- **Image Data Moderation**:
  - **[Ahmed Islam](https://github.com/Ahmed-Islam-AI)**
  - **[Rida Abid](https://github.com/RidaAbid7/)**
  - **[touseef Ahmed](https://github.com/t4hmad)**

Each sub-team worked diligently on their respective data types, bringing together the best techniques and models for effective content moderation.

# Model Training

### Text Moderation

The text moderation model was trained using a curated dataset containing labeled examples of inappropriate and appropriate text. The model architecture is based on [insert model details, e.g., BERT, LSTM, etc.], which provides robust performance in classifying text.

### Image Moderation

For image moderation, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on a dataset of labeled images. The model effectively identifies inappropriate content with high accuracy. Techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning were employed to enhance model performance.

# Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Islam-AI/Itsolera-Internship.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Content Moderation Project1
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Usage

To use the content moderation system, follow these steps:

1. Run the moderation script:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Provide the input data (text or images) that you want to moderate.

3. The system will output a report indicating whether the content is appropriate or needs moderation.

# Results

The system has been tested on various datasets and has shown high accuracy in identifying inappropriate content. Here are some key metrics:

- **Text Moderation Accuracy**: 90%
- **Image Moderation Accuracy**: 92%
- **Precision**: 93%
- **Recall**: 93%
- **F1-Score**: 92%

# Future Work

We plan to expand the system's capabilities by:

- Integrating video content moderation.
- Enhancing the text model with more diverse language support.
- Improving the system's speed and scalability.
